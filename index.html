      <h1>Welcome to the Custom Manifest PWA</h1>
      <p>
        This app uses an inlined web manifest stored in local storage to allow easily customizing any aspect of the manifest, as well as exposing different versions to different users/profiles/browsers.
        At page load time the inline web manifest and field below are both updated to show the 'current' version of the manifest as far as this user is concerned.
        To update this 'current' version simply modify the field below and invoke the 'Update' button, which will update the value and reload the page (refreshing the inline web manifest).
        From there you can use any of the browser-provided installations methods to install the PWA.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to update the manifest please note that paths need to be fully qualified.
        If you would like to replace an image reference, CustomBlack.png, CustomBlue.png, CustomGreen.png, and CustomOrange.png are all available at the same location for easy reference.
        If you encounter any problems please see the Console first (including Debug level), as the backing scripts may be already logging answers for you.
      </p>
      <p>tl;dr; Update the manifest below (if desired), press 'Update', use your browser to install.</p>
      <div>
        <button id="update">Update</button>
        <button id="reset">Reset to default</button>
